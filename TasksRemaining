***KNOWN ISSUES***

1.  Logical axioms for three classes of microbiological culture media are not functioning.

2.  There are a number of new terms that are being requested for entry into ChEBI.  Temporary terms are located under the class "ChEBI terms to be added and processed"

3.  External ontologies are currently being imported using temporary owl files (created by OntoFox) in the "MicrO and Import Modules" folder.  Once the domain name request has been approved and purl addresses assigned, these will be replaced.


__Tasks remaining/ongoing:

1) Finish logical axioms for inferring problematic classes of microbiological media


__Tasks which will likely wait until the next round of funding and development:

1) Incorporating classes of prokaryotic habitat qualities - possibly in conjunction with ENVO (?)

2) Incorporating classes of prokaryotic pathogenic phenotypes


__Tasks waiting for outside developemnt(s):

1) A number of chemical terms are temporary classes until they are added to ChEBI


__OBO Foundry Tasks:

1) Request name space and permanent URLs

2) Update OWL file to include PURLs
