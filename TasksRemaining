***KNOWN ISSUES***

1.  Logical axioms for three classes of microbiological culture media are not functioning. 
(have determined that this is likely a Protege issue)

2.  There are a number of new terms that are being requested for entry into ChEBI.  Temporary terms are located under the class "ChEBI terms to be added and processed"
(update Sept 26 2015: request to ChEBI has been made = Tracker # [chebi:curator-requests] #2466.  Once terms are entered into ChEBI the temporary items in MicrO will be replaced).
(update Jan 13 2016: New ChEBI terms were incorporated into MicrO.  An additional 88 new terms were requested to be added to ChEBI [Tracker #3133 on GitHub]).
(update Jan 23, 2018): All the requested terms were incorporated into MicrO using ChEBI_imports.owl import module.  Additional new terms remain to be requested to be added to ChEBI as they are discovered.  These are given temporary IRIs.


__Tasks remaining/ongoing:

1) Finish logical axioms for inferring problematic classes of microbiological media


__Tasks which will likely wait until the next round of funding and development:

1) Incorporating classes of prokaryotic habitat qualities - possibly in conjunction with ENVO (?)

2) Incorporating classes of prokaryotic pathogenic phenotypes
