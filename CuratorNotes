Notes from initial Coordination Call with OBI-Devel on 10/17/2015:

Carrine and Ramona working in MicrO (ontology for Microbial)

    a. MicroPIE is an information extraction process
    b. Extracted terms and synonyms concerning taxonomic descriptions 
    c. other ontologies involved: PATO, GO + CHEBI   
    d. A large number of Microbial assays are curated from the literature.
    e. Carrine has attempted to convert them to OBI's underlying design, including logical axioms to terms within other ontologies
    f. She has submitted hundreds of terms to CHEBI for inclusion 
    g. each assay includes links to other ontologies. 
    h. Ramona would like to look for specific points of overlap between the logical definitions used in this model for assays based on harmonizing assays.
    i. James described templates in OBI with links and discussions (https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obi-build/blob/master/templates/epitope-assays.tsv)
    j. Generating OWL from the template is built using James' 'robot' tool.  
    k. We would like to follow up with Carrine to coordinate a follow up call with both Bjeorn, Chris and Jie. 
    l. Where should we put everything? MicrO has a lot of domain-specific assays. There's and people will discuss this going forward. 

Thanks everyone for participating.
