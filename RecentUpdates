Added several new classes of undefined organic chemical mixtures and revised logical axioms.  Added trans-aconitate asimilation assay, aconitate assimilation assay, alph-aminobutyrate assimilation assay, and polyethylene glycol assimilation assay, beta-glucuronidase assay with 4-MU, 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase assay, 6-phospho-beta-galatosidase assay with oNP, alpha-galactosidase assay with 4-MU, beta-glucosidase assay with 4-MU, butyrate esterase assay, hydrolase assay, DNAse assay with indoxyl, DNase assay with pNP.  Improved definitions for enzymatic assay classes.

Updated Oct 14, 2015:
Replaced MicrO Object Property 'has unit' with IAO term 'has measurement unit label'and Data Property 'has magnitude' with IAO term 'has measurement value'.  Updated term usages across the ontology. 

Added note to README document Notice Regarding IRI Addresses: IRI addresses for imported ontology terms and for MicrO-specific terms are currently temporary. They will be replaced with the correct purl addresses, once a domain name has been approved by OBO (request is pending in the OBO-Discuss-List), and after we have better acquainted ourselves with OBO purl conventions!
