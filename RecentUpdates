Updated Oct 14, 2015:
Replaced MicrO Object Property 'has unit' with IAO term 'has measurement unit label'and Data Property 'has magnitude' with IAO term 'has measurement value'.  Updated term usages across the ontology. 

Added note to README document Notice Regarding IRI Addresses: IRI addresses for imported ontology terms and for MicrO-specific terms are currently temporary. They will be replaced with the correct purl addresses, once a domain name has been approved by OBO (request is pending in the OBO-Discuss-List), and after we have better acquainted ourselves with OBO purl conventions!
