A Microbial Ontology of Phenotypic Characters Found in Prokaryotic Taxonomic Descriptions

Alpha Version

Created by Carrine E. Blank, University of Montana, fall 2013 through summer 2015.

This alpha version of the ontology includes terms and term synonyms found in over 1200 prokaryotic taxonomic descriptions, collected from a diverse set of taxonomic descriptions from Archaea, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Mollicutes.  

Contains ~ 1,550 terms and term definitions, along with thousands of term synonyms.  Constructed in OWL Protégé; following OBO Foundry principles.  Imports ~7,800 terms from 11 other ontologies, including Phenotype Quality (PATO), the Gene Ontology (GO), and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI).  Contains >15,000 logical axioms connecting entities and processes across multiple ontologies to facilitate inference of higher-order phenotypic traits.

Many thanks to Hong Cui (University of Arizona), Ramona Walls (New York Botanical Garden), Lisa Moore (University of Southern Maine), Gail Gasparich (Towson University), and Gordon Burleigh (University of Florida) for assistance with ontology construction and compilation of taxonomic descriptions.

Thanks to Oliver He (University of Michigan) for technical assistance with OntoBee and OntoFox, and Gareth Owen (ChEBI project leader, head curator) for assistance in the incorporation of microbial-specific chemical terms and synonyms into ChEBI.

Thanks also to the instructors (Melissa Haendel, Matt Yoder, Jim Baihoff) and students of the 2013 NESCent Ontologies for Evolutionary Biology workshop, and to Karen Cranston (NESCent director) and the support staff at NESCent.

This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life Program (DBI-1208534), and by a travel grant to attend the 2013 NESCent Ontologies for Evolutionary Biology workshop.
